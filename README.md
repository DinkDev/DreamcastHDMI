# DreamcastHDMI / DCHDMI

#### 2019-02-06 *Firmware v2.2.0*

- Fixed: It was possible to flash a firmware file from the OSD, which was only partially downloaded or corrupt.
It was possible to brick DCHDMI with that, so access to the serial port was necessary to fix. Starting with v2.2.0 the checksum is verified before flashing to prevent flashing a broken firmware.

  *this only affected the firmware upgrade via OSD, the web interface upgrade was already performing this check*

  Instructions on how to recover can be found here: [How to recover from a corrupted ESP firmware](Recovery.md)

#### 2019-02-01 *Firmware v2.1.1*

- Improved HDMI compliance

    - Use recommended values for 44.1kHz audio in 1080p mode

    - Use limited RGB range for all output resolutions other than VGA

- Improved reliability

    - Removed `ESP.eraseConfig()` on full reset as this can lead to SPIFFS corruption in some rare cases.

    - Disabled persisting WiFi credentials to ESP internal config area (they are already stored in flash file system), to reduce flash wear.

#### 2019-01-22 *Firmware v2.1.0*

***Update is highly recommended!***

- Improved WiFi security

    - `WiFi Setup` OSD screen now displays the actual WiFi mode it's in (`Connected`/`Access point`)

    - WiFi AP password is now being generated every time DCHDMI enters `Access point` mode.
    
    - Generated WiFi AP password password can be displayed in `WiFi Setup` OSD screen.

    - If no *web console* `HTTP Password` is set, it's also generated every time DCHDMI starts.

    - `HTTP User` now defaults to `dchdmi` instead of `Test`

    - The `HTTP Password` set can also be displayed in `WiFi Setup` OSD screen, unless `Protected mode` is set to `on` during `setup` procedure. (In this case you need access to the serial console, if you have forgotten your `HTTP Password`)

#### 2019-01-08 *Firmware v2.0.0*

- Bob deinterlacing can be deactivated via new `Advanced Video Settings`.

    Set `Deinterlacer` to `passthru` to output 480i/576i.

- PAL support (576p bob deinterlaced or 576i passthru)

- OSD can show changelog after `Check` for new firmware.

- Web interface `setup` procedure shows available options and checks for valid input.

- GDEMU reset was available in main menu, even when disabled.

- Full reset (DC, ESP, FPGA) now available in `Reset DC`

- Video Mode can be changed by holding dpad up/down (`ForceVGA`/`CableDetect`) on startup/full reset.

- Lots of FPGA firmware improvements and refactoring.

#### 2018-12-18 *Firmware v1.2.0*

- All output modes (*VGA/480p/960p/1080p*) now support dreamcast 240p games.

    Because video timing for 240p is different from 480i/p, the video output does not fully comply with the HDMI specification, so 960p/1080p may not work on all TVs (monitors usually work fine).

- For some 240p games the active video area is shifted to the right, so there is a new option under `Output Resolution` to compensate for that: `240p adjust position`

#### 2018-11-11

- Changed the button layout for the OSD control: *A* and *B* are now remapped to *R* and *L*, to reduce button conflicts with the game running in the background.

    Thanks to ***-=FamilyGuy=-*** from the assemblergames forum for this idea!

- ESP firmware is now built using *PlatformIO, version 3.6.1*

#### 2018-09-20

- Updated the firmware to reflect the DCHDMI 1.3 hardware changes. The OSD now contains the following:

    - **Output Resolution selection.**
        
        Select *VGA*, *480p*, *960p* and *1080p* from the OSD.
    
    - **Scanlines.**

        *On/Off*, *Intensity*, *Odd/Even* and *Thick/Thin*

    - **Video Mode Setup.**

        Select *ForceVGA*, *CableSelect* and *SwitchTrick* for startup.

    - **Firmware Upgrade.**

        *Download* and *flash* new firmware from OSD, and also *reset* DCHDMI.

    - **WiFi Setup.**

        Enter *SSID* and *Password* for a quick wifi configuration from OSD.

    - **Reset Configuration.**

        DCHDMI can now reset the dreamcast. It can also reset the USB-GDROM (to return to the menu), in which case an additional connection is necassary. This pin can also be used to press the GDEMU button. By default it's connected to the onboard LED. So here you can configure to what and if this optional wire is connected.

        - *LED:* use onboard diagnostic LED
        
        - *GDEMU:* connected to the button on the GDEMU

        - *USB-GDROM:* connected to the USB-GDROM reset circuit

#### 2018-09-03

- Finished OSD with the following features:

    - **Output Resolution selection.**
        
        Select *VGA*, *480p*, *960p* and *1080p* from the OSD.
    
    - **Video Mode Setup.**

        Select *ForceVGA*, *CableSelect* and *SwitchTrick* for startup.

    - **Scanlines.**

        *On/Off*, *Intensity*, *Odd/Even* and *Thick/Thin*

    - **Firmware Upgrade.**

        *Download* and *flash* new firmware from OSD, and also *reset* DCHDMI.

    - **Debug Info.**

        Debug information.

- Integrated **FirmwareManager** into this project, as the coupling between ESP and FPGA is very tight now.

- Added upscaling of 480i content to 960p/1080p.

#### 2018-08-14

- Dynamic reconfiguration of the output resolution.

    Output resolution is now configurable via WiFi webinterface, OSD integration will follow soon.

- Removed 10CL016 and EP4CE6 support.

#### 2018-08-05

Updated the old 2017 block diagram to reflect some of the changes introduced since then:

![Block diagram 2018][DCblockNew]

#### 2018-07-29

- Maple bus integration to read controller data

    Uses code by Marcus Comstedt (zeldin) from his [MapleMojo](https://github.com/zeldin/MapleMojo) project.
    <br>This enables leeching controller data directly from the maple bus to control the OSD.

- Added [I2C slave](https://opencores.org/project/i2cslave) implementation by Steve Fielding.

    Enables ESP to write to OSD RAM and get the controller data aquired from the maple bus to control OSD.

#### 2018-07-17

##### Mainboard 1.2e *[Link](https://github.com/citrus3000psi/DCHDMI-Hardware)*

Finally finalized hardware ðŸŽ‰ All interference issues are solved, we're now entering beta phase!

##### Rolling releases

The `master` branch will now contain the latest stable release. Development version moved to `develop`.

Firmware updates are easily downloaded and installed via WiFi [FirmwareManager](https://github.com/chriz2600/FirmwareManager).

Currently the following features are planned:

- OSD
- Output resolution switchable via OSD
- Dreamcast video mode control (pin6)
- 480p trick
- 240p x2 and x3 modes
- Disc based firmware updates

#### 2018-05-09

##### Mainboard 1.2d *[Link](https://github.com/citrus3000psi/DCHDMI-Hardware)*

Close to final FPGA mainboard by [citrus3000psi](https://twitter.com/citrus3000psi).

Some features are currently unused (e.g. pads for maple bus integration).<br>They will allow some cool firmware extensions in the future (e.g. OSD)

##### Flat flex 1.2a

[citrus3000psi](https://twitter.com/citrus3000psi) designed a flat flex cable, which connects the Mainboard to the audio and video dacs.

##### Cylcone 10 LP (10CL025):

We switched to a bigger FPGA to support more video output modes, 10CL016 and EP4CE6 are also supported.

| Output | Resolution | Notes | 10CL025 | 10CL016 | EP4CE6 |
|:-:| -:| - |:-:|:-:|:-:|
| VGA | 640x480 | **Correct** pixel/aspect ratio! | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| 480p | 720x480 | Original output: usually only 640px of the available 720px are used.<br>**Incorrect** pixel/aspect ratio! | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| 960p | 1280x960 | x2 VGA | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: |
| 1080p | 1280x960 | x2 VGA, framed in 1920x1080 | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |

##### Other firmware features

- basic 480i line doubling

- 240p support

- Scanlines. <br>Available by rebuilding the firmware and defining `SCANLINES_EVEN/SCANLINES_ODD`, `SCANLINES_THICK/SCANLINES_THIN` and `SCANLINES_INTENSITY` in `Macros.qsf`

- *Upcoming:* OSD. Maple bus connection is already on the 1.2d mainboard. Will be used in a later firmware.

#### 2018-03-05

Restructured source code and updated pin assignments for citrus3000psi's DCHDMI board 1.1: 
- [Mainboard][citrus3000psi-oshpark-mainboard]
- [QSB][citrus3000psi-oshpark-qsb]

Moved older versions (without ADV7315 and/or ICS664-3) to [v0.1][v0.1]

Restructured "firmware" site:
- [Firmware][firmware]

Details on the available versions can be found [here][firmware-docs].

#### 2017-12-21

Added ESP-12 based firmware management tool, for upgrading firmware via WiFi.

- A demo of the FirmwareManager could be found here: [Demo][dcfwdemo]

#### 2017-06-11

Many thanks to citrus3000psi for his work on a QSB (quick soldering board).
Check out the thread on the shmups forum: [DreamcastHDMI github by chriz2600][shmups]

#### 2017-05-29

New (auto)-build system using docker. [Build system using docker][docker]

#### 2017-04-23

Added schematics and some information on Cyclone IV + ADV7513 + ICS664-3 build: [CycloneIV-ADV7513-ICS664][builddoc]

#### 2017-04-18

A new version of the Cyclone IV + ADV7513 version is available [here][FPGA-CycloneIV-ADV7513-Enhanced].

Features in this version:
- Recoding of 480p (720x480) to VGA (640x480). 

    HDTVs will display correct 1:1 instead of 8:9 pixel ratio for 4:3 aspect ratio. To achieve the required clock multiplication/division an [ICS664-03] digitial video clock source is used. 
    320 pixel are buffered in RAM, so the delay from this will be 11.9us (microseconds, I will call this zero delay :) ) 
    
    This diagram shows the setup:

![Block diagram][DCblock]

- Support for 480i and 240p by line doubling with recoding to 480p as above.

- Support for 480p/480i switching detection

Not in this version:

- PAL 576i support

##### Cheaper FPGA

Instead of a [DE0 Nano SOC][de0nanosoc] you can also use a [Waveshare CoreEP4CE6 Development Board][CoreEP4CE6]. You can get it for 20-25$ via [Aliexpress][AliCoreEP4CE6]. The project folder for this is [FPGA-CycloneIV]. Because the board does not expose any clock pins, you have to desolder the oscillator and attach the dreamcast clock directly to the board.

![Oscillator][CoreEP4CE6-Oscillator]

##### ADV7513

I also created a board for experimenting with the [Analog Devices ADV7513 HDMI Transmitter][ADV7513] which can be found [here][ADV7513p]. The verilog code for this can be found [here][FPGA-CycloneIV-ADV7513].

##### Direct HDMI output from FPGA

If you want to go the "cheap" DIY route, i've made a PCB for the [LVDS2TMDS][LVDS2TMDSboard] part.

##### Dreamcast video output

Some details about the Dreamcast scaling issue on modern HDTVs: [Video details link]

##### Roadmap

0. ~~Create cheaper solution based on simple FPGA development board.~~
0. ~~Use FPGA to enable 480p mode. Currently I have to plug in a VGA cable ;)~~
0. ~~Design FPGA board with Cyclone IV FPGA and ADV7513 transmitter. I'm planning to include some RAM to be able to implement 480i as well as basic upscaling later.
    Edit: I don't need external RAM for line doubling.~~
0. ~~Design flat flex circuit to connect Dreamcast video DAC and audio DAC to FPGA board.~~
0. Detailed HOWTOs.
