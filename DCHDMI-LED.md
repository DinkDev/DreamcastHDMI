## DCHDMI LED status patterns

*LED status is only available, when `Opt. reset mode` in console setup is set to `led`*

#### **LED off**

No clock from Dreamcast. 

*Check connection to `VCLK`*

#### **LED rapid blinking**

No proper sync signal is detected (It's normal to see this at startup/reset)

*Check connections to `VSYNC` and `HSYNC`*

#### **LED slow glow**

Dreamcast clock and sync signals are fine, no cable plugged into HDMI port.

*Plug in HDMI cable or replace with another cable*
