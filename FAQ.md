# DCHDMI/DreamcastHDMI FAQ

## What is it?

DCHDMI is an internal HDMI output solution for the Dreamcast.

## Why do we need this, there are already the Behar Bros Akura DC HDMI Box and the Pound HD Link Cable for Dreamcast?

- DCHDMI is a full digital to digital solution. It takes the signals directly off the GPU (Holly) and the audio processor (AICA) before entering video and audio DACs.
- DCHDMI fixes the Dreamcast's aspect/pixel ratio issue, by converting the weird Dreamcast 480p signal and converts it to a fully HDMI compliant 640x480 signal.
- DCHDMI supports pixel doubling to 960p and 960p in a 1080p frame.
- DCHDMI also handles 480i and 240p content.

## What's about the original analog output?

The original audio/video DAC remains untouched, so analog output works as before.

## Does it support higher resolutions e.g. 2160p output?

No, there are currently no HDMI 2.0 ICs freely available. They require to have a HDMI/DCP license.
